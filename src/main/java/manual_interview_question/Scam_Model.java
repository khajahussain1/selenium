     Scrum Overview - Introduction to Scrum Terms
     
     An introduction to Scrum would not be complete without knowing the Scrum terms you'll be using. This section in the
     Scrum overview will discuss common concepts in Scrum.  

  1. Scrum team: A typical scrum team has between five and nine people, but Scrum projects can easily scale into the 
    hundreds. However, Scrum can easily be used by one-person teams and often is. This team does not include any of the 
    traditional software engineering roles such as programmer, designer, tester or architect. Everyone on the project 
    works together to complete the set of work they have collectively committed to complete within a sprint. Scrum 
    teams develop a deep form of camaraderie and a feeling that “we’re all in this together.”

  2. Product owner: The product owner is the project’s key stakeholder and represents users, customers and others in 
   the process. The product owner is often someone from product management or marketing, a key stakeholder or a key 
   user.

 3. Scrum Master: The Scrum Master is responsible for making sure the team is as productive as possible. The Scrum 
    Master does this by helping the team use the Scrum process, by removing impediments to progress, by protecting 
    the team from outside, and so on.

 4. Product backlog: The product backlog is a prioritized features list containing every desired feature or change to 
   the product. Note: The term “backlog” can get confusing because it’s used for two different things. To clarify, 
   the product backlog is a list of desired features for the product. 
   The sprint backlog is a list of tasks to be completed in a sprint.


 5. Sprint planning meeting: At the start of each sprint, a sprint planning meeting is held, during which the product 
   owner presents the top items on the product backlog to the team. The Scrum team selects the work they can complete 
   during the coming sprint. That work is then moved from the product backlog to a sprint backlog, which is the list of 
   tasks needed to complete the product backlog items the team has committed to complete in the sprint.

  6. Daily Scrum meeting: Each day during the sprint, a brief meeting called the daily scrum is conducted. This meeting helps 
    set the context for each day’s work and helps the team stay on track. All team members are required to attend the 
    daily scrum.

  7. Sprint review meeting: At the end of each sprint, the team demonstrates the completed functionality at a sprint 
  review meeting, during which, the team shows what they accomplished during the sprint. Typically, this takes the 
  form of a demonstration of the new features, but in an informal way; 
  for example, PowerPoint slides are not allowed. The meeting must not become a task in itself nor a distraction from 
  the process.

 8. Sprint retrospective: Also at the end of each sprint, the team conducts a sprint retrospective, which is a meeting 
   during which the team (including its ScrumMaster and product owner) reflect on how well Scrum is working for them 
   and what changes they may wish to make for it to work even better.
