   Difference Between Test Plan and Test Strategy
   
   A Test Plan is a formal document derived from requirement documents, describing in detail the scope of testing and 
   the different activities performed in testing. Whereas, a test strategy is a high-level document describing the way
    testing will be carried out in an organization


             Test Plan	                                              Test Strategy
1.	A test plan is derived from Software Requirement Specification    A test strategy is a high-level document describing the  
    (SRS), describing in detail the scope of testing and the          way testing is carried out.
    different activities performed in testing.	
    
2.	A test plan is specific to a particular project.	              A test stategy is normally for a complete organization. Although 
                                                                      it can be specifed for a particular project as well.
                                                                      
3.	It describes the whole testing activities in detail               It describes the high-level test design techniques to be used, 
   - the techniques used, schedule, resources etc.	                  environment specifications etc.
   
4.	It is prepared by test lead or test manager.	                  It is generally prepared by the project manager.

5. Components of Test plan include- Test plan id, features to         Components of Test strategy includes- objectives and scope, 
   be tested, test techniques, testing tasks, features pass or        documentation formats, test processes, team reporting 
   fail criteria, test deliverables, responsibilities, and            structure, client communication strategy, etc
   schedule, etc.
   
6. Test plan is carried out by a testing manager or lead that         A test strategy is carried out by the project manager.   
   describes how to test, when to test, who will test and what        It says what type of technique to follow and which module 
   to test                                                            to test
   
7. Test plan can change                                               Test strategy cannot be changed

8.  It is defined at project level                                     It is set at organization level and can be used by multiple
