    C# is a programming language of .Net Framework.

    Our C# tutorial includes all topics of C# such as first example, control statements, objects and classes, inheritance, 
    constructor, destructor, this, static, sealed, polymorphism, abstraction, abstract class, interface, namespace, 
    encapsulation, properties, indexer, arrays, strings, regex, exception handling, multithreading, File IO, Collections etc.

 1)  What is C#
     C# is pronounced as "C-Sharp". It is an object-oriented programming language provided by Microsoft that runs on 
     .Net Framework.

    By the help of C# programming language, we can develop different types of secured and robust applications:

    Window applications
    Web applications
    Distributed applications
    Web service applications
    Database applications etc.
    
    
    Java vs C#
    There are many differences and similarities between Java and C#. A list of top differences between Java and C# are given 
    below:

	   Java	                                                                      C#
1)	Java is a high level, robust, secured and object-oriented      C# is an object-oriented programming language developed by
    programming language developed by Oracle.	                   Microsoft that runs on .Net Framework.
2)	Java programming language is designed to be run on a Java      C# programming language is designed to be run on the Common  
    platform, by the help of Java Runtime Environment (JRE).	   Language Runtime (CLR).
3)	Java type safety is safe.	                                   C# type safety is unsafe.
4)	In java, built-in data types that are passed by value are      In C#, built-in data types that are passed by value are 
    called primitive types.	                                       called simple types.
5)	Arrays in Java are direct specialization of Object.	           Arrays in C# are specialization of System.
6)	Java does not support conditional compilation.	               C# supports conditional compilation using preprocessor 
                                                                   directives.
7)	Java doesn't support goto statement.	                       C# supports goto statement.
8)	Java doesn't support structures and unions.	                   C# supports structures and unions.
9)	Java supports checked exception and unchecked exception.	   C# supports unchecked exception.

*  C# Namespaces:- 
*  
   Namespaces in C# are used to organize too many classes so that it can be easy to handle the application.

   In a simple C# program, we use System.Console where System is the namespace and Console is the class. To access the class 
   of a namespace, we need to use namespacename.classname. We can use using keyword so that we don't have to use complete name 
   all the time.

   In C#, global namespace is the root namespace. The global::System will always refer to the namespace "System" of 
   .Net Framework.
